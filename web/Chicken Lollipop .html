            <img src="ingra.png"height="500px">
            <h5>Ingredients</h5>
            ▢15 chicken lollipop pieces<br>
1st Marinade<br>
▢2 tablespoon red chilli paste<br>
▢2 tablespoon ginger garlic paste<br>
▢1 teaspoon soy sauce<br>
▢1/2 teaspoon chilli vinegar
▢1 teaspoon salt<br>
            <h4>2nd Marinade</h4>
▢2 tablespoon corn flour<br>
▢2 tablespoon rice flour<br>
▢2 tablespoon maida / all purpose flour<br>
▢1 tablespoon kashmiri chilli powder<br>
▢1 teaspoon red chilli powder<br>
▢1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder<br>
▢1/8 teaspoon salt<br>
▢3 tablespoon water adjust as needed<br>

           <h4> Ingredient Notes:</h4>
           <h4>Chicken Lollipop pieces</h4> – If you get ready lollipop pieces at the store, then this recipe will hardly take any time or effort to make, because all you need to do is marinate it with spices listed & fry!<br><br>

If however you don’t get lollipop pieces at the store, then you’ll need to make it from wings, which is fairly simple too, but you’ll have to account for time to do that. I’ve shared how to make chicken lollipop pieces from chicken wings in a video shared below.<br><br>

2 Step Marination – This recipe calls for 2 different marinades, which I recommend you follow – one for flavoring the chicken, and the other mostly for giving it the crispy coating.<br><br>

But both marinades require really basic spices and sauces that are readily available.<br>

           <h4> Substitutions & Variations:</h4>
            <h4>Chilli vs chilli garlic sauce </h4>– If you want a more garlicky flavor, then you can substitute chilli sauce with chill garlic sauce or do half & half.<br><br>

           <h4> Egg for marination</h4> – Some folks use egg in the second marinade, but I don’t prefer to use it, as it results in a runnier batter & a thicker coating, which will not give you the authentic restaurant like taste & texture.<br><br>

           <h4> How to Make Chicken Lollipop from Chicken Wings</h4>
If you get readymade lollipop pieces at the store, then you can skip this video. If however you get chicken wings, then watch this to know how to make lollipop from wings, before moving on to the recipe.<br><br>
           <h4> How to Make Chicken Lollipop at Home</h4>
            <h4>First Marinade</h4>
In a large bowl, mix together red chilli paste, ginger garlic paste, soy sauce, chilli vinegar, and salt.<br><br>

Then mix in the chicken lollipop pieces, and let the chicken marinate in the spice mix for 15-20 minutes.<br><br>


            <h4>Second Marinade</h4>
In a bowl, mix together corn flour, rice flour, maida, red & kashmiri chilli powder, salt & pepper powder, and add the mix to the marinated chicken, along with some water, and mix everything together.<br><br>

Adjust the quantity of water required little by little as there will be some moisture from the earlier marinade.<br><br>

The goal is to get a semi thick paste-like marinade.<br><br>

          <h4>  Frying the Lollipops</h4>
The lollipops might lose their shape during mixing and marination, so ensure to re-shape them, right before frying them. And also at that time spread the marinade around the lollipop, so it gets somewhat of an even coat.<br><br>
            Then deep fry the lollipop pieces, a few at a time, so as to not overcrowd the pan, and fry for 5-7 minutes till the chicken has cooked, and has turned crisp and golden brown.
           <h4> Serving Suggestion</h4>
I usually love to eat chicken lollipops as is, with just some chaat masala sprinkled on them. But both green chutney and schezwan chutney make for great dips for chicken lollipops.
